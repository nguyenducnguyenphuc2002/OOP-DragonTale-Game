<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> 
This is our game project for our final lab in our Object-Oriented Programming course. It's a standalone game that doesn't demand exceptional skills or sophisticated technology. This simple yet engaging game is suitable for individuals of all age groups. Dragon Tale presents an exciting 2D adventure where players take charge of a dragon maneuvering through dangerous landscapes, engaging in battles with various foes, and collecting coins to accumulate points. The main goal is to defeat monsters and gather coins to increase the player's score. Through our efforts, we've designed a user-friendly program aimed at providing users with the most enjoyable experiences possible.

## METHODOLOGY <a name ="METHODOLOGY"></a>üî¶
### HOW TO PLAY üí°

The team made an effort to change the game's original regulations. The key points are summarized as follows:

**__GAME AIMS__:** to slay every monster and collect coins along the way to obtain the greatest number of points and coins possible.

**__BEGINNING PLAYER__:** begins with 10 health, 25 fireballs that reload after firing, and no cash or points.

**__THE PLAYER__:** battles against a variety of adversaries, such as money, birds, sluggers, danger zones, mushrooms, and a monster (spider), the user controls the Dragon Tale.

**__THE INTERACTIVE To__:** combat a variety of adversaries, such as money, birds, sluggers, danger zones, mushrooms, and a monster (spider), the user controls the Dragon Tale.

**__PASSING STARTING POINT__:** The locations where you start are extremely hazardous and teeming with creatures.

**__Player__:** You are the dragon's embodiment, and you can manipulate the one with keys.

**__Keys__:** Along with other keys like W for jumping, E for gliding, R for scratching, and F for firing, KEYS includes <--,‚Üë,‚Üì--> for the move. 

**__FIREBALLS__:** The dragon's fireballs, which are generated by player bullets, shoot when you hit the F key.

**__FIRING AND SCRATCHING__:** There are two ways for a player to attack: firing for long-range strikes and scratching for short-range attacks.

**__ENEMIES__:** Besides avoiding or travelling through the teleports, every creature has a different amount of poison and damage.

**__ARANIK__:** is a tiny spider which moves up or down in response to harm, and the amount of damage is one.

**__HATMONKEY AND SLUGGER__:** are two creatures that move from right to left and go back with the damage of the two.

**__A BIRD__:** is a robot disguised as a bird that soars at a height, dealing 4 damage and requiring a jump to destroy.

**__A HERO__:** is a mushroom, but since they can move, you must use caution when handling them because their damage is just three.

**__BOSS__:** is a king spider that is excessively big for any object on the map. It shoots venom that deals damage equivalent to a mushroom. You should avoid it since every time you cross paths with it, you will lose five health.

**__VENOM__:** A boss's contaminate is called a "venom," and it is unintentionally released from the spider.

**__TELEPORT__:** You have to stay away from them since it's a hazardous spot where you will perish if you traverse it.

**__COINS AND POINTS__:** You get an extra coin and 100 points for eliminating an adversary. These are the same coins that are found on the streets.

### DESIGNüè∑
#### 1. THE UX/UI
Since UI/UX has always been our main focus before we launched the game, we have received a lot of input from other people to establish a pattern. 

A 2D adventure and action game is called Dragon Tale. The game narrates the tale of Dragon Tale, a green dragon who is courageous and strong yet also good-natured and giving.

In the game, players will battle monsters by controlling Dragon Tale. The game is appealing to players of all ages and incorporates gorgeous 2D graphics.

The following crucial components have been identified to build the UI/UX for the Dragon Tale game:

* Information to display:
  * Player
    * Dragon Tale
    * Health
    * FireBall
    * Coins
    * Points
  * Enemies
    * Mini monsters:
      * Bird
      * HatMonkey
      * Slugger 
      * Arachnik
      * Hero
    * Boss: 
      * Boss
      * Vemon 
  *  Control the character
    
        | Key | Action |
        |:--:| :--: |
        | <--,--> | RUN |
        | W | JUMP |
        | R | SCRATCHING |
        | F | FIRING |
        | W+E| FLY|
     
      * Use <--,--> to move the knight.
      * Use R and F to attack the enemies.
      * Watch the amount of fireballs below your amount of health as it decreases when you use F.
      * Fight the boss with I without losing health.
      * Keep the boss chasing you to prevent them from healing
#### 2. GAME ALGORITHM
After much iteration and troubleshooting, we now have the project structure as seen in the image below. 

![Annotation 2024-01-04 221710](https://github.com/nguyenducnguyenphuc2002/OOP-DragonTale-Game/assets/125187213/e56ba842-adfe-46e8-9cb3-c9893e9e6312)

The classes we teach can be arranged into distinct groups, like:

**__MapObject__:** is the superclass of the classes including the Player class to display the player's information (dragon tale), the Enemies class to describe various monsters in the road, the teleport class, the venom class to describe the enemies' venom to attack the player, and the collectable class to describe the coins in the journey. 

**__Enemies__:** is the superclass of all the classes, which includes the boss category or classes that are similar to mini-monsters like Hero, Slugger, Arachnik, and Hat Monkey.

**__Die Enemies__:** is the superclass of all the classes, which includes DieBoss, DieHero, DieSlugger, DieArachne, and DieHatMonkey.

**__Animation__:** is used to describe the frame's actions of Entities. 

**__HUD__:** displays information including fireballs, health, coins and scores. 

**__Background__:** displays the background of the game 

**__Tile and TileMap__:** are used to display deep holes and walls in the game. 

**__AudioPlayer__:** creates the music, even the sound of Dragon‚Äôs firing and scratching

**__Abstract class GameState__:** displays the state of the game; its subclass HelpState demonstrates how to play; Level1State depicts the initial fight screen; MenuState shows several options; and WinnerState and GameOverState indicate when the player succeeds or fails. 

**__GameStateManager__:** is a manager class various the state class inherits GameState class. 

**__Game and GamePanel__:** is intitaied even controlling the programing.
